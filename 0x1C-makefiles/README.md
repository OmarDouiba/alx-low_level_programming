## What is Makefile
A Makefile is a simple text file that contains a set of rules describing how to compile and build a project. Each rule specifies a target (the file to be generated), dependencies (the files needed to generate the target), and the command to generate the target. The syntax is as follows:
```Makefile
target: dependencies
    command
```
